Van Dijk is a physically strong, right-footed centre-back, who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although he can also play as a right-sided centre-back. He is gifted with pace, good technique, and an eye for goal, and is an effective set-piece taker. Regarding his ability, former Celtic teammate Kris Commons commented that Van Dijk was "comfortable on the ball", also noting that "He had good technique and a wonderful right foot.</p>

                    <p>Pos: Forward <br>Nat: Brazilian<br>DOB: 2 Oct 1991<br>Described by Jürgen Klopp as the ‘engine’ of his team, Roberto Firmino is a Champions League-winning striker who does so much more than just score goals.Blessed with prodigious physical gifts that complement his exceptional footballing talents, the Brazil international leads Liverpool’s line with a fearsome and influential combination of industry and ingenuity.Alongside Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, Firmino forms part of one of Europe’s premier attacking trios and scored 43 goals over the course of the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons to help the Reds reach back-to-back Champions League finals.</p>

Handed his senior debut for Liverpool on the opening day of the 2015-16 season, aged just 18, Gomez sustained a serious knee injury while on international duty with England U21s shortly after Jürgen Klopp’s arrival in October 2015. After a 17-month spell on the sidelines, Gomez returned to action in January 2017, and signed a new long-term contract with the club that same month.</p>

He opened his goalscoring account for the Reds in October 2016, powerfully heading in at Crystal Palace.</p>

Now firmly established as one of the world’s premier full-backs, Robertson was, incredibly, still playing for Queen’s Park in his native Glasgow as recently as 2013. Over the course of two seasons with Liverpool - following a transfer from Hull City in the summer of 2017 - Robertson has played in consecutive Champions League finals having progressed from squad player to key component in Jürgen Klopp’s team.</p>

He arrived to the club in July 2018 from AS Roma and enjoyed an incredible first season on Merseyside.Alisson has been praised for his crucial saves, positioning, distribution and consistency, and is widely regarded as the best shot-stopper in the Premier League, and by some as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. Alisson cites former Barcelona goalkeeper Víctor Valdés as an inspiration, due to his ability to play out from the back, as well as Manuel Neuer, for his 'sweeper keeper' style.</p>
